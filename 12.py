"""
This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s
and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the
set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string 'de' and the set of strings
[dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data
structure to speed up queries.
